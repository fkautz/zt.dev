## About Frederick

[LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/fkautz)

Frederick Kautz is a distinguished leader in open-source and cloud-native communities, with over 10 years of kubernetes and docker experience, extensive expertise in software supply chain security, Zero Trust, and networking. He co-authored the influential NIST Special Publication 800-204D, Strategies for the Integration of Software Supply Chain Security in DevSecOps CI/CD Pipelines, which has significantly influenced the Department of Defense’s Enterprise DevSecOps Fundamentals version 2.5 by defining the software supply chain. 

At Elevance Health, Frederick served as the lead architect for the Sydney Health app, a comprehensive mobile platform that provides users with personalized health information, digital ID cards, and access to care services. Collaborating closely with the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) and the security team, Frederick was instrumental in defining the company’s Zero Trust strategy and the onboarding of Google Cloud Platform (GCP), transforming Elevance Health’s cloud infrastructure for secure, scalable growth.

Frederick also architected WorkOS, Elevance Health’s enterprise platform designed to streamline operations and enhance collaboration across the organization. By integrating advanced security measures and scalable cloud solutions, he ensured that WorkOS met the complex needs of a large healthcare enterprise.

His leadership extends to his tenure as Co-Chair of KubeCon + CloudNativeCon (now Emeritus), where he helped expand the global cloud-native community and set new standards for security and inclusivity. As a current member of the SPIFFE Steering Committee, Frederick continues to drive standards in workload identity and Zero Trust.

As an innovator, Frederick co-founded OmniBOR and ProtoBOM, advancing transparency in binary provenance and software bill of materials (SBOM) practices. In 2019, he developed one of the first federated learning platforms for healthcare, enabling collaborative research while preserving patient privacy. Additionally, he is a co-founder of Network Service Mesh. He has contributed to modernizing network infrastructure for secure, cloud-native networking solutions. He also defined the “CNF: Cloud Native Network Function,” which transformed network service provider architectures by enabling them to run on cloud architectures like Kubernetes.
